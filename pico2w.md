##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ BlueSCSI Pico 2 W Upgrade - Universal Firmware ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

{% include carousel2.html %}

This is to purchase a new Pico 2 W (with a BlueSCSI of course) rather than the normal wifi v1 Pico. This is the extra cost of the new version added to your order. Add this item to your Cart if you want a Pico 2 W installed to the fully assembled BlueSCSI or your kit version of the BlueSCSI. Please do NOT add it if you are purchasing a board ONLY kit as this kit does not include a Pico. The latest universal firmware is already flashed. The Pico 2 does bring some write speed improvements. See here [https://github.com/BlueSCSI/BlueSCSI-v2/pull/218](https://github.com/BlueSCSI/BlueSCSI-v2/pull/218)

* Additional cost of Pico 2 Wifi
* Upgrades your order to replace Pico with Pico 2 Wifi
* ONLY purchase with a BlueSCSI V2 fully assembled or kit
* Universal Firmware will be pre-flashed
