##### 3D Print cases and brackets for your BlueSCSI

We now have a wide range of 3D Mounts/Cases for your BlueSCSI. You can view them at the bottom of each regional page, or [all on this page here](/3dprints). Please make sure you add them to your Cart before checkout if you require one. We now produce high quality PLA prints using a Prusa printer and Polyterra PLA. We charge a small fee for these prints, but you are welcome to print your own. You will not receive a 3D bracket/case if you don't add one to your Cart. We are licensed to sell mounts by PotatoFi which can be found on Printables here â†’ [PotatoFi](https://www.printables.com/@PotatoFi){:target="_blank"}

##### Purchasing 3D Prints ONLY
If you ONLY need to purchase a 3D print, as you built a BlueSCSI yourself, we do sell them separately from the Paypal links below which show the postage cost. Postage is free if purchased WITH a BlueSCSI. This is more of a service to those without a 3D printer.
