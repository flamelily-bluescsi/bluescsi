This is a carefully designed slim (15,4 x 5,3 cm) 10Mbit Zorro II Compatible AMIGA Network Card. We have a limited supply of Purple Gold (ENIG). This card was designed as an accessory for Denise. A slim network card perfect for those Mini-ITX chassis. Already supported by AmigaOS TCP/IP stacks like Miami, AmiTCP and RoadShow with existing drivers (Ariadne2).

This is not ready for plug & play! It is a bare PCB. This is a Super slim Zorro II AMIGA Compatible Network Card for Denise. This is low profile so will fit in compact Mini ITX cases. You will need to source everything as this is the PCB only. You will also need to program the CPLD (U7) with the firmware. You will get an email with BOM details, and firmware files after dispatch.

* Amiga Zorro II network card PCB
* No components or connectors included
