##### 🇪🇺 EU Desktop Kit 🇪🇺

{% include carousel2.html %}

This is the Desktop Kit version of the V1 BlueSCSI for EU/Rest of the World buyers. Some soldering will be required to complete this device. If you prefer a complete and tested device please choose the Full option. The micro SD socket is pre-soldered to the PCB so only through hole soldering is required. View build instructions [HERE](https://shop.flamelily.co.uk/assets/pdfs/BlueSCSI_assembly.pdf)

* Version 1.1 PCB
* SD card socket soldered
* Works better with Vintage Mac's
