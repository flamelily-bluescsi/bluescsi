This is the NEW version 2 Desktop Kit version of the BlueSCSI for 🇪🇺 EU buyers. This has the right angle header and molex, see the straight option if you want a straight up header and molex. Some soldering will be required to complete this device. If you prefer a complete and tested device please choose the Full option. The Suface Mount Components are pre-soldered to the PCB so only through hole soldering is required.
