##### ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU Desktop Kit ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

![{{page.cart_description}}]({{page.cart_image}})

This is the Desktop Kit version of the BlueSCSI for EU/Rest of the World buyers. Some soldering will be required to complete this device. If you prefer a complete and tested device please choose the Full option. The micro SD socket is pre-soldered to the PCB so only through hole soldering is required.

* Version 1.1 PCB
* SD card socket soldered
* Works better with Vintage Mac's
