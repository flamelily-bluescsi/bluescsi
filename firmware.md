If you purchased a version 1 BlueSCSI before 11/04/2022 from us or any authorised seller, that means your BlueSCSI does not have the ability to be updated easily via a USB cable connected to the micro USB port. Your device must be in working order and then we will update it to the latest firmware and load the USB Bootloader. The next time there is an update you will be able to easily update it with a USB cable. If you would like to try the update yourself and have an [ST Link updater](https://github.com/erichelgeson/BlueSCSI/wiki/ST-Link-Setup) then follow the instructions by clicking the button below, else click the purchase link below and you will then receive an email with the shipping address to post your BlueSCSI to. If you have more than one to update, please use our contact form to contact us.
