This is to purchase a VGA Adapter PCB for Denise. Add this to your Denise order for a VGA output via the internal RGB connector on the motherboard (labelled H1). This will ONLY work for 15Khz compatible monitors. You will need to source some components as we only include the capacitor and IC at C1 and U1. We have a Google spreadsheet with the BOM [here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oHfT9QUCcRQ_YKXXuV0mXPfL9rg2KvKyZhjl9AIMDw/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}
