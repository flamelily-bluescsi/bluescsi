##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º BlueSCSI V2 Pico Wifi Upgrade ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

{% include carousel2.html %}

This is to purchase a Pico Wifi version (with a BlueSCSI of course) rather than the normal non wifi Pico. This is the extra cost of the wifi version added to the order. Add this item to your Cart if you want a Pico Wifi installed to the fully assembled BlueSCSI or your kit version of the BlueSCSI. Please do NOT add it if you are purchasing a board ONLY kit as this kit does not include a Pico. The latest firmware is already flashed and this includes the Wifi element.

* Additional cost of Wifi Pico
* Upgrades your order to replace Pico with Pico W
* ONLY purchase with a BlueSCSI V2 fully assembled or kit
* Latest Firmware will be pre-flashed
