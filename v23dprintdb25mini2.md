Please view [3D Print Information Page](/print) for purchasing 3D prints separately. This is to purchase 3D prints when purchasing a BlueSCSI device at the same time as postage is included. This is the second option case for the V2 DB25 Mini BlueSCSI. This helps protect the V2 DB25 Mini BlueSCSI externally. For the 2023.06a and 2024.01a board revisions. This case was created for the 2023.06a version, but the 2024.01a version fits (since it is a reduced width) with a caveat that you might need some double sided tape or similar to keep it in place since there is no mounting hole on the PCB. Also since this print is wider than the PCB, there are certain situations that ports next to the SCSI port will be blocked by this print. Please check your ports!

* 3D PLA print (fossil grey)
* Fits both the Mini DB25 versions (2023.06a and 2024.01a)
* Slide fit and solid
* ONLY for purchase with a BlueSCSI
