##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ UK Desktop Board Only Kit V2 Straight Header ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

![{{page.cart_description}}]({{page.cart_image}})

This is the NEW version 2 Desktop Board Only Kit version of the BlueSCSI for UK buyers. This has the straight header and molex, see the right angle option if you want a right angle header and molex. Some soldering will be required to complete this device. If you prefer a complete and tested device please choose the Full option. The Suface Mount Components are pre-soldered to the PCB so only through hole soldering is required. You will need to supply your own Raspberry Pi Pico!

* New Version 2
* SMD already soldered
* Straight up headers
* No Pico supplied
