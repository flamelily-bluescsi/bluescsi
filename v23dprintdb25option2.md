Please view [3D Print Information Page](/print) for purchasing 3D prints separately. This is to purchase 3D prints when purchasing a BlueSCSI device at the same time as postage is included. This is a second option for a case for the V2 DB25 BlueSCSI. This has rounded corners and no screws, with just pressure fit side locks. This helps protect the V2 DB25 BlueSCSI externally.

* 3D PLA print (fossil grey)
* Pressure fitting
* Protecting Case
* ONLY for purchase with a BlueSCSI
