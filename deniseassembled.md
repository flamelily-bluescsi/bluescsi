##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Amiga Denise Fully Assembled (No Amiga custom IC's included) ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

{% include carousel1.html %}
<br>

Denise is an re-created Amiga mainboard which is Mini-ITX sized. More info about Denise can be found <a href="https://www.enterlogic.se/?page_id=180" target="_blank">here</a>. The concept is an extremely compatible, stable yet flexible hobbyist Amiga home computer. From ESD protected I/O ports to high fidelity audio components and crystal clear RGB video. You have to hear and see it to believe it.

To get the best from both worlds, Denise contains a few modern components. Two MCU's control things like Amiga/PC keyboard, Amiga/PS/2 mouse and scroll wheel support, floppy disk detection, debug information and Big/ROM selection. All of this resulting in a small, semi modern, super stable and expandable home computer system. There is no exact match but Denise can easiest be described as a compact A500+ compatible motherboard with two Zorro2 compatible slots and a few additional features.

Included in the Fully Assembled version:<br>
1 x Denise PCB populated with sockets, connectors and minor components.<br>
1 x 72-pin SIMM (2MB CHIP)<br>
2 x MCU with necessary firmware

This item is lovingly built by our builder in-house, and has taken many hours of careful soldering! The included SIMM PCB does have all components soldered and is fully tested. You will of course need to source a set of Amiga ECS chipset custom chips and Kickstart ROM. A battery damaged A500+ is a great source for this. This PCB has twice the copper of previous boards as well as High-definition Exposure Silkscreen on the new beautiful SIMM.

Important information: 
Please be aware that this is tested by us, but no support is offered when using your own chipset as we cannot verify these components ourselves. We are the <b>registered UK reseller</b> for the Denise, and the project maintainer will get a commission for every Denise we sell. If you are outside the UK you should purchase from [https://www.enterlogic.se](https://www.enterlogic.se/?page_id=34){:target="_blank"}
