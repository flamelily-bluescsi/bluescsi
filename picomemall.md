##### 🌍🇬🇧 PicoMEM All in One 8-Bit ISA Expansion Card 🇬🇧🌍

{% include carousel2.html %}

The PicoMEM is an 8-bit ISA expansion card based on the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller.  It offers a huge range of features and aims to be an all-in-one solution for ISA-based vintage PCs. The card fits all ISA slots fine without a bracket, but you can print a 3D version from [here](https://github.com/FreddyVRetro/ISA-PicoMEM/tree/main/stl){:target="_blank"}. We don't supply a 3D printed bracket as it's not very hardy and in our experience breaks easily. We are looking into sourcing a metal bracket supplier for future. Your PicoMEM comes as default with a Pico W so NE2000 networking can be used straight away. Please make sure you test the Wifi functionality VERY close to the wifi router, since the Pico W does not have a wifi antenna.

* NE2000 Network Support emulation
* Built-in MicroSD card reader
* USB Mouse & Joystick Support
* Latest Rev 1.14 PCB now with [gold ENIG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroless_nickel_immersion_gold){:target="_blank"}
* Pico W pre-flashed with latest firmware
* This does NOT include the audio add-on. Add an adLib audio board [here](/adlibpicomem)

Price includes shipping costs.
