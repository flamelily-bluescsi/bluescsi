##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Amiga Denise PCB Kit ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

{% include carousel4.html %}
<br>

Denise is an re-created Amiga mainboard which is Mini-ITX sized. More info about Denise can be found <a href="https://www.enterlogic.se/?page_id=180" target="_blank">here</a>. The concept is an extremely compatible, stable yet flexible hobbyist Amiga home computer that you build yourself. Which now thanks to the ingenious design based mainly on through hole components is really easy to build. Even if you're not a wizard with a soldering iron! Denise is designed with quality components throughout. From ESD protected I/O ports to high fidelity audio components and crystal clear RGB video. You have to hear and see it to believe it.

To get the best from both worlds, Denise contains a few modern components. Two MCU's control things like Amiga/PC keyboard, Amiga/PS/2 mouse and scroll wheel support, floppy disk detection, debug information and Big/ROM selection. All of this resulting in a small, semi modern, super stable and expandable home computer system. There is no exact match but Denise can easiest be described as a compact A500+ compatible motherboard with two Zorro2 compatible slots and a few additional features.

Included in the Kit:<br>
1 x Denise PCB (Mini-ITX)<br>
1 x 72-pin SIMM PCB (2MB CHIP)<br>
2 x MCU with necessary firmware

We include ALL SMD components pre soldered on the main board PCB! This saves lots of time and makes Denise even easier to assemble! Please note that the included SIMM PCB does not have any components pre mounted. You will of course also need to source a set of Amiga ECS chipset custom chips. A battery damaged A500+ is a great source for this. This new PCB batch also has twice the copper of previous boards as well as High-definition Exposure Silkscreen on the new beautiful SIMM.

Important information
Please be aware that his is NOT a plug and play product. You are purchasing two high quality (TG-155/ENIG) PCBs, two firmware ICs and build instructions. No warranty or support is offered.
