##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ UK Desktop Kit ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

{% include carousel2.html %}

This is the Desktop Kit version of the V1 BlueSCSI for UK buyers. Some soldering will be required to complete this device. The micro SD socket is pre-soldered to the PCB so only through hole soldering is required. View build instructions [HERE](https://shop.flamelily.co.uk/assets/pdfs/BlueSCSI_assembly.pdf)

* Version 1.1 PCB
* SD card socket soldered
* Works best with SCSI I devices (use V2 for better compatibility)
* Once this stock is sold this page will be removed
