Please view [3D Print Information Page](/print) for purchasing 3D prints separately. This is to purchase 3D prints when purchasing a BlueSCSI device at the same time as postage is included. This is another more bulky option for the V2 Desktop, with a single mounting screw. This gives a more solid fit and has 4 side mounting points like a traditional hard drive.

* 3D PLA print (fossil grey)
* Solid fit, 4 side mounting points
* Fits standard Hard drive bays
* ONLY for purchase with a BlueSCSI
