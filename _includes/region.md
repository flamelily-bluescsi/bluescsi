The V2 Desktop version allows you to directly connect your BlueSCSI to a vintage SCSI drive and copy data from it without needing a bootable "Host Device" or computer. Image those failing SCSI drives. See [this DOC](https://bluescsi.com/docs/Initiator-Mode){:target="_blank"} for more info. The latest firmware will be flashed to every Pico we send out.
