##### PCB Stock Levels

This is our stock level page to help buyers to see our current stock. Since this is a hobby site please understand that we have a FULL TIME job and so while we will do our best, sometimes stock might run out. Stock is based on the PCB levels we have so since the stock is also used across regions so we don't have different stock levels for UK or EU/Rest of the world buyers.<br>
Also this is <b>not real time</b> but we will do our best to regularly update this page. This is useful for buyers looking to make multiple purchases as if there is only a single board in stock and you purchase multiple, there might be a dispatch delay.
