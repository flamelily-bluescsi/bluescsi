##### PCB Stock Levels V2

This is our stock level page to help buyers to see our current stock. Since this is a hobby site please understand that we have a FULL TIME job and so while we will do our best, sometimes stock might run out. Stock will be based on the PCB levels we have so for instance our desktop boards have options for straight and right angle connector, so stock will be the same for both, and if you see 5 for desktop, this stock is used for both straight and right angle connector versions. The stock is also used across regions so we don't have different stock levels for UK or EU buyers.<br>
Also this is <b>not real time</b> and we do our best to regularly update this page. This mainly should be used for buyers looking to make multiple purchases as you can then see if there is only a single board in stock and you purchase multiple, there might be a dispatch delay.
