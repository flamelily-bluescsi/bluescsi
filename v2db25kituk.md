##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ V2 DB25 Kit UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

![{{page.cart_description}}]({{page.cart_image}})

This is the NEW version 2 DB25 Kit version of the BlueSCSI for UK buyers. This is usually used externally from the computer. Some soldering will be required to complete this device. If you prefer a complete and tested device please choose the Full option. The Suface Mount Components are pre-soldered to the PCB so only through hole soldering is required.

* New Version 2
* SMD already soldered
* Includes pre-flashed Pico
