##### Product Stock Levels

This page explains our stock process to help buyers. We are not Amazon and do not have a fancy stock control system, so since this is a hobby site please understand that we have a FULL TIME job and so while we will do our best, sometimes stock might run out. Stock is based on the PCB levels we have, so since fully assembled and kit versions of our products use the same PCB's there are not different stock levels for these. On some products we rely on other people to supply us, so product stock is not within our control.<br>

Each item page will show a stock number above the price, but this is <b>not real time</b> and we do our best to regularly update each page. This is useful for buyers looking to make multiple purchases as if there is only a single board in stock and you purchase multiple, there might be a dispatch delay. Some things like the Raspberry Pi Pico's, and 3D prints we don't show a stock number as these are for purchase with a product and not on their own. You can of course purchase "board only" kits and supply your own Pico.

If we do go out of stock, we do our best to give an estimate on each page when we hope to have stock. Please understand this is always an estimate and not a definite date.

##### Thanks for your understanding.
