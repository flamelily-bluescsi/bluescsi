##### ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º BlueSCSI V2 Initiator EU ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º

![{{page.cart_description}}]({{page.cart_image}})

This is to purchase a NEW Initiator BlueSCSI version, more info [Here](https://github.com/BlueSCSI/BlueSCSI-v2/wiki/Initiator-Mode). This allows you to directly connect your 2023.09a Desktop Hardware version BlueSCSI to a vintage SCSI drive and copy data from it without needing a bootable "Host Device". Please add a [Pico Wifi](/picowifi) if you would like to  include the Wifi element, else it will come with a normal Pico without Wifi. This will be jumper configured for normal SCSI drive operation. Please read the Wiki, link above, to see how to configure and use the Initiator Mode.

* NEW Board just released
* Initiator Board with 2 SD sockets and USB C
* Please add Wifi Pico option if needed
* Fully soldered and tested
