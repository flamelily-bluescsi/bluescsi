##### 3D Print cases and brackets for your V2 BlueSCSI

You now will receive a free 3D printed bracket or case with your BlueSCSI V2 device (when available). Please understand these prints are functional and not meant to be high quality professional prints, produced by a print farm or similar. If you are looking for that type of solution, please see PotatoFi's ETSY store here â†’ [PotatoFi Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/PotatoFi){:target="_blank"} where you will find some high quality print solutions for the BlueSCSI. (updated V2 designs coming)

If you would like one of our 3D prints, as you built a BlueSCSI yourself, we do sell them separately for the cost of a beer and postage (Sorry UK only). This is more of a service to those without a printer. Please see these Paypal links to purchase them:
