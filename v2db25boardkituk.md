##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ V2 DB25 Board Only Kit UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§

![{{page.cart_description}}]({{page.cart_image}})

This is the NEW version 2 DB25 Kit Board only version of the BlueSCSI for UK buyers. This is usually used externally from the computer. Some soldering will be required to complete this device. If you prefer a complete and tested device please choose the Full option. The Suface Mount Components are pre-soldered to the PCB so only through hole soldering is required. You will need to supply your own Raspberry Pi Pico!

* New Version 2
* SMD already soldered
* No Pico supplied
