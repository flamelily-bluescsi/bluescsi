##### 🇬🇧🌍 BlueSCSI Ultra - Front Panel - COMING SOON 🌍🇬🇧

{% include carousel1.html %}

This is Front Panel for the BlueSCSI Ultra. This Front Panel is an optional extension for all BlueSCSI Ultra boards that was designed by Polpo for the [PicoIDE.](/picoide) This is the exact same Front Panel that will be used on the PicoIDE and will be interchangable. In other words you can connect it to a PicoIDE or a BlueSCSI Ultra. Just remember the narrow 50 pin Ultra needs the [expander](/narrowexpander) to work with this.

Please visit the excellent documentation page here - [https://picoide.com/docs/front-panel/](https://picoide.com/docs/front-panel/){:target="_blank"} to see all the functionality of this board.

Ultra Wide (68 pin and SCA 80 pin) has the SPI port built-in, so it doesn't need the Expander - just connect the Front Panel directly via the flex cable. See more detailed info about the new ultra products [HERE.](https://bluescsi.com/ultra){:target="_blank"}

* Latest PCB revision
* Comes with short flex cable (7.5cm)
* Tested and complete
