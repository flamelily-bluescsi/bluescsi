##### ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ BlueSCSI Pico 2 Upgrade - BETA Firmware ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡ºðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

{% include carousel2.html %}

This is to purchase a new Pico 2 (with a BlueSCSI of course) rather than the normal non wifi v1 Pico. This is the extra cost of the new version added to your order. Add this item to your Cart if you want a Pico 2 installed to the fully assembled BlueSCSI or your kit version of the BlueSCSI. Please do NOT add it if you are purchasing a board ONLY kit as this kit does not include a Pico. The Pico 2 W can be added [here](/pico2w). The latest Pico 2 BETA firmware is already flashed. Please be aware this firmware is BETA, but does bring some write speed improvements. See here [https://github.com/BlueSCSI/BlueSCSI-v2/pull/198](https://github.com/BlueSCSI/BlueSCSI-v2/pull/198)

* Additional cost of Pico 2
* Upgrades your order to replace Pico with Pico 2
* ONLY purchase with a BlueSCSI V2 fully assembled or kit
* BETA Firmware will be pre-flashed
* No wifi with this option. Need Pico 2 Wifi go [here](/pico2w)
